## Code Patterns and Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Component Structure
```javascript
/**
 * Component Name - Brief description
 * 
 * Detailed explanation of what the component does, its purpose,
 * and key features it provides
 */
const ComponentName = () => {
  // State management
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  // Custom hooks and computed values
  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {
    // Complex computation with comments
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Effect hooks with detailed explanations
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect logic with comments
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Helper functions with JSDoc
  /**
   * Function description
   * @param {type} param - Parameter description
   * @returns {type} - Return value description
   */
  const helperFunction = (param) => {
    // Implementation
  };
  
  // Render methods for different sections
  const SectionComponent = () => (
    // JSX with descriptive comments
  );
  
  // Main render
  return (
    // Main JSX structure
  );
};
```

### 2. WebSocket Management Pattern
All pages use a consistent pattern for WebSocket connections:
- Connection establishment with error handling
- Message type discrimination
- Real-time data updates
- Cleanup on component unmount
- Fallback dummy data for development

### 3. D3.js Integration Pattern
For data visualization pages:
- SVG ref management
- Responsive dimension calculation
- Performance-optimized rendering
- Memory cleanup and re-rendering logic
- Mobile-responsive chart sizing

### 4. Material-UI Theming
Consistent design patterns:
- Responsive breakpoints
- Color scheme adherence
- Card-based layouts with hover effects
- Gradient backgrounds
- Typography hierarchies

## Current Progress Summary

**Progress: 50% Complete** - The 5 most complex and important pages have been fully refactored with comprehensive comments and improved structure.

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. Follow the established component structure pattern
2. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
3. Create reusable sub-components for complex sections
4. Include performance considerations for large datasets
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness
6. Add appropriate error handling and loading states

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All functions have JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments explaining the "why"
- [ ] Components are broken down into logical, reusable pieces
- [ ] WebSocket connections have proper cleanup
- [ ] Charts and visualizations are performance-optimized
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- [ ] Error states and loading indicators are present

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) v5
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js for maps and charts
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connections
- **Mapping**: TopoJSON/GeoJSON with D3 geographic projections
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- **Responsive Design**: Material-UI breakpoints and responsive helpers

## Performance Considerations

1. **Chart Rendering**: Use performance optimizations like simplified rendering for D3.js
2. **Data Processing**: Use useMemo for expensive computations
3. **WebSocket Management**: Proper cleanup and connection state management
4. **Large Datasets**: Pagination and virtual scrolling where appropriate
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive chart sizing and simplified interfaces

## Security Notes

- WebSocket connections use the configured base URL from config
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed in the frontend
- All external links use appropriate security attributes (noopener, noreferrer)
- Input validation on data received from WebSocket connections
