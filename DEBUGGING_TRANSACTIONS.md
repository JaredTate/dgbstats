# TxsPage Debugging - Current Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

From the screenshot provided, we can see:

1. **Mempool transactions are loading correctly** - 5 real unconfirmed transactions showing
2. **Real-time data is connected** - No demo data, only real blockchain data
3. **Transaction details display properly** - Values, fees, sizes, and priorities all showing
4. **Search and filter functionality** - UI controls are present

## üîç Issue: Confirmed Transactions Not Loading

The "Recent Confirmed Transactions" section might be empty because:

1. **Low network transaction volume** - Many recent blocks only contain coinbase transactions
2. **Need to search more blocks** - Current code searches up to 20 blocks

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools Added

### 1. Enhanced Server Logging

The server now shows detailed information when updating transaction caches:
- How many blocks are checked
- Which blocks contain transactions
- Transaction values and details
- Summary statistics

### 2. Transaction Check Script

```bash
cd /Users/jt/Code/dgbstats-server
node check-transactions.js
```

This script directly checks the blockchain to show:
- Last 10 blocks and their transaction counts
- Transaction IDs and values
- Current mempool status

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Run the debug script** to check if recent blocks actually contain transactions:
   ```bash
   node check-transactions.js
   ```

2. **Check server logs** when the cache updates to see what's being found

3. **Consider increasing search depth** if network has low transaction volume:
   ```javascript
   // In server.js, updateConfirmedTransactionsCache()
   const maxBlocksToCheck = 50; // Increase from 20
   ```

4. **Monitor with lifecycle test**:
   ```bash
   node test-transaction-lifecycle.js
   ```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

When working correctly:
- Confirmed transactions should load immediately on page load
- As mempool transactions get mined into blocks, they should move to the confirmed list
- The server caches the last 10 confirmed transactions for instant delivery

## üí° Recommendations

If the network genuinely has low transaction volume:
1. Display a message explaining low network activity
2. Search more historical blocks (50-100) to find transactions
3. Show block information even without transactions
4. Consider showing aggregated statistics instead
