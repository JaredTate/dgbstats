## What is DigiDollar?

### DGB as a Limited, Finite Strategic Reserve Asset

With a maximum supply of 21 billion DGB, there are only **1.94 DGB per person** on Earth (based on 8.1 billion world population). Combined with DigiByte's **15-second block speed** (40x faster than Bitcoin), this extreme scarcity and fast settlement makes DGB ideal as collateral for DigiDollar - a truly finite backing for instant, stable currency transactions.

### Simple Explanation

DigiDollar is a proposed stable digital currency that would always equal $1 USD, created by locking up DigiByte (DGB) as collateral. DGB would become a strategic reserve asset - with only 21 billion max supply (just 1.94 DGB per person on Earth), it's a truly finite asset backing the stability of DigiDollars.

Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by bank accounts, DigiDollar would be the world's first truly decentralized stablecoin on a UTXO blockchain. No company or bank would control it.

**Most importantly**: Everything would happen directly in your DigiByte Core wallet - you would never give up control of your private keys or trust a third party.

### Key Benefits

- ✅ World's first truly decentralized stablecoin on UTXO blockchain
- ✅ Always worth $1 USD - stable and predictable
- ✅ You keep full control of private keys in Core wallet
- ✅ DGB becomes strategic reserve asset
- ✅ 15-second blocks (40x faster than BTC), $0.01 fees

## How It Works

### Core Idea: The Silver Safe Analogy

**Imagine DGB is silver** stored in your basement safe. You have $1,000 worth of silver but need cash today. Instead of selling your silver (and losing future gains), you lock it in a special time-locked safe.

The safe gives you $500 cash to spend today. **The silver NEVER leaves your possession** - it stays in YOUR basement, in YOUR safe. You just can't access it until the timelock expires.

10 years later, your silver is worth $10,000 (10x gain)! To unlock: Simply return the $500 to the safe → get your $10,000 silver back. You kept ALL the appreciation.

#### That's EXACTLY how DigiDollar works:

- ✅ Lock DGB in YOUR wallet (never leaves your control)
- ✅ You ALWAYS keep control of your private keys
- ✅ Get DigiDollars to spend today
- ✅ When timelock expires, burn DD → get your DGB back
- ✅ Keep ALL the DGB price appreciation

### The Tax Advantage: Liquidity Without Selling

In most jurisdictions, **borrowing against assets is NOT a taxable event**. This is exactly what billionaires do - they never sell their stocks, they borrow against them.

**Traditional Crypto Sale:**
- ❌ Sell DGB → Pay 20-40% capital gains tax
- ❌ Lose future appreciation
- ❌ Taxable event recorded

**DigiDollar Method:**
- ✅ Lock DGB → Get DigiDollars
- ✅ No taxable event (in most jurisdictions)
- ✅ Keep ALL future DGB gains
- ✅ Theoretically never need to sell DGB

_* Tax laws vary by jurisdiction. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation._

### Economic Incentives: Why This Benefits Everyone

#### 🔒 DGB Becomes More Scarce

**1.94 DGB per person on Earth** (21B max supply ÷ 8.1B population)

With only 21 billion DGB ever to exist, locking DGB for DigiDollars makes an already scarce asset even more scarce. This creates natural price support.

- **Reduced selling pressure**: Locked DGB can't be panic sold during market volatility
- **Supply shock potential**: Significant locking could create supply squeeze
- **Benefits all DGB holders**: Even unlocked DGB benefits from reduced circulating supply

#### 💰 Personal Financial Benefits

DigiDollar provides unprecedented financial flexibility for DGB holders, enabling sophisticated wealth management strategies.

- **Tax-efficient liquidity**: Access funds without triggering capital gains
- **Keep upside potential**: Maintain full exposure to DGB price appreciation
- **Strategic flexibility**: Lock portions based on liquidity needs

**The Network Effect**: The more people use DigiDollar, the stronger the DGB ecosystem becomes. Locked DGB creates scarcity → drives price → attracts more users → creates more demand for both DGB and DigiDollar. It's a positive feedback loop that benefits all participants.

### The Technical Process

#### 1. Lock DGB Collateral
Users lock DigiByte as collateral in a smart contract. The amount depends on the lock period (150%-400% of DigiDollar value).

#### 2. Mint DigiDollars
DigiDollars are automatically minted based on the locked DGB value and current USD exchange rate from decentralized oracles.

#### 3. Use & Redeem
Use DigiDollars for stable transactions. Redeem them anytime to unlock your DGB collateral after the lock period expires.

## Collateral Requirements

DigiDollar uses a sliding collateral scale to prevent attacks while rewarding long-term participants:

| Lock Period | Collateral Ratio | Undercollateralized After | DGB for $100 |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 30 days    | 500%            | 80% drop                  | 500 DGB      |
| 3 months   | 400%            | 75% drop                  | 400 DGB      |
| 6 months   | 350%            | 71.4% drop                | 350 DGB      |
| 1 year     | 300%            | 66.7% drop                | 300 DGB      |
| 3 years    | 250%            | 60% drop                  | 250 DGB      |
| 5 years    | 225%            | 55.6% drop                | 225 DGB      |
| 7 years    | 212%            | 52.8% drop                | 212 DGB      |
| 10 years   | 200%            | 50% drop                  | 200 DGB      |

**Note**: The updated collateral schedule (500% → 200%, up from 300% → 100%) provides enhanced stability. The "Undercollateralized After" column shows how much DGB price can drop before position becomes undercollateralized. 5 and 7 year options added for more flexibility.

## Technical Implementation

### Revolutionary Architecture

DigiDollar would be the world's first truly decentralized stablecoin built natively on a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) blockchain. All operations occur directly in DigiByte Core wallet - users maintain complete control of their private keys throughout the entire process.

### Core Technologies

#### Taproot Integration
Enhanced privacy using P2TR outputs and Schnorr signatures

#### Decentralized Oracles
15 independent price feeds with 8-of-15 consensus requirement

#### MAST Implementation
Efficient script execution with Merkleized Alternative Script Trees

### Key Features

- ✅ No forced liquidations during market volatility
- ✅ All transactions appear identical on-chain (privacy)
- ✅ Batch signature verification for efficiency
- ✅ Native blockchain integration (no side chains)

---

## Technical Implementation Details

DigiDollar leverages advanced Bitcoin Script opcodes and DigiByte's unique capabilities to create a trustless, decentralized stablecoin system:

### Time Lock Mechanism

#### OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV)
Enforces time-based collateral lock periods (30 days to 10 years)

#### OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)
Enables relative time locks for redemption windows

#### nLockTime
Prevents transactions from being mined until specified block height

### Core Script Functions

#### Multi-Sig Oracle Validation
8-of-15 Schnorr threshold signatures for price consensus

#### Taproot Script Paths
Multiple redemption conditions in a single P2TR output

#### MAST Trees
Merkleized scripts for privacy and efficiency

### How It Works - Simple Technical Flow

#### 1. Minting Process
User creates a P2TR output with DGB collateral, embedding time lock (CLTV) and oracle price data. Script validates collateral ratio and mints corresponding DigiDollars.

#### 2. Oracle Verification
15 independent oracles sign price data. Script requires 8-of-15 signatures using Schnorr threshold aggregation, ensuring decentralized price consensus.

#### 3. Redemption Process
After time lock expires (verified by CLTV), user can redeem DigiDollars to unlock DGB. Script burns DigiDollars and releases collateral to user's address.

**Key Innovation**: Unlike Ethereum-based stablecoins that require smart contracts and gas fees, DigiDollar uses native UTXO script capabilities for superior security, lower costs, and true decentralization. The entire system operates without intermediaries, smart contract risks, or custody requirements.

## Four-Layer Protection System

### The Time-Lock Challenge

Since collateral is cryptographically time-locked, there are **NO forced liquidations or margin calls**. Positions must ride out the full term regardless of market conditions. This requires a unique protection approach.

### 1️⃣ Higher Collateral Requirements (First Defense)

The 500%→200% sliding scale provides massive buffer against price drops. Short-term positions require up to 5x collateral, protecting against volatility.

**Example**: With 500% collateral, DGB can drop 80% before undercollateralization.

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Collateral Adjustment (Second Defense)

As system health changes, collateral requirements automatically adjust:

- **>150% healthy**: Normal operations
- **120-150%**: +25% collateral required
- **110-120%**: +50% collateral required
- **<110%**: +100% collateral required

### 3️⃣ Emergency Redemption Ratio (Third Defense)

If system drops below 100% collateralized, redemptions require more DD to unlock collateral.

**Formula**: Required DD = Original DD × (100% ÷ System %)

**Example**: At 80% system health, need 125 DD to redeem position that minted 100 DD

### 4️⃣ Supply & Demand Dynamics (Natural Defense)

Locked DGB reduces circulating supply, creating natural price support. With only 21B DGB max, locking creates scarcity.

**Effect**: More locking → Less supply → Higher DGB price → Better collateralization

### Real-Time System Monitoring

The system continuously tracks critical health metrics to ensure stability:

- Total DGB locked per tier
- Total DigiDollars minted
- Per-tier collateral ratios
- Aggregate system health

Accessible via RPC command: `getdigidollarsystemstatus`

**Key Insight**: These four layers work together without forced liquidations. Prevention (higher collateral), adaptation (dynamic adjustment), crisis management (emergency ratios), and market forces (scarcity) create a self-balancing, resilient system.
